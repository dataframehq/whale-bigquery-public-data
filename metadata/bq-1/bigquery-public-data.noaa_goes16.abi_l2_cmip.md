  - Date and time of the last data point in the dataset (UTC). Format is YYYY-MM-DD”T”HH:MM:SS.s”Z”.
* [TIMESTAMP] `date_created`
  - Date and time when dataset file was created (UTC). Format is YYYY-MM-DD”T”HH:MM:SS.s”Z”.
* [FLOAT]     `geospatial_westbound_longitude`
  - Westernmost longitude in decimal degrees covered by the dataset.

  - Minimum reflectance factor value of good and conditionally usable quality pixels.
* [FLOAT]     `max_reflectance_factor`
  - Maximum reflectance factor value of good and conditionally usable quality pixels.
* [FLOAT]     `mean_reflectance_factor`
  - Mean reflectance factor value of good and conditionally usable quality pixels.
* [FLOAT]     `std_dev_reflectance_factor`
  - Standard deviation of reflectance factor values of good and conditionally usable quality pixels.
* [FLOAT]     `min_brightness_temperature`
  - Minimum brightness temperature value of good and conditionally usable quality pixels.
