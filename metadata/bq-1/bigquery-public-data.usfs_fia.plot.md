Actual plot coordinates cannot be released because of a Privacy provision enacted by Congress in the Food Security Act of 1985. Therefore, this attribute is approximately +/- 1 mile and, for annual inventory data, most plots are within +/- ½ mile. Annual data have additional uncertainty for private plots caused by swapping plot coordinates for up to 20 percent of the plots. In some cases, the county centroid is used when the actual coordinate is not available.
* [INTEGER]   `elevation`

Rounded to the nearest 10-foot category for certain FIA work units (SURVEY.RSCD = 23 or 24), and rounded to the nearest 100-foot category for other FIA work units (SURVEY.RSCD = 22, 26, 27, or 33). Negative values indicate distance below sea level.
* [INTEGER]   `type_of_annual_volume_growth_code`
  - A code indicating how volume growth is estimated. Current annual growth is an estimate of the amount of volume that was added to a tree in the year before the tree was sampled, and is based on the measured diameter increment recorded when the tree was sampled or on a modeled diameter for the previous year. Periodic annual growth is an estimate of the average annual change in volume occurring between two measurements, usually the current inventory and the previous inventory, where the same plot is evaluated twice. Periodic annual growth is the increase in volume between inventories divided by the number of years between each inventory. This attribute is blank (null) if the plot does not contribute to the growth estimate.
* [STRING]    `type_of_annual_volume_growth_code_name`
  - A code indicating how volume growth is estimated. Current annual growth is an estimate of the amount of volume that was added to a tree in the year before the tree was sampled, and is based on the measured diameter increment recorded when the tree was sampled or on a modeled diameter for the previous year. Periodic annual growth is an estimate of the average annual change in volume occurring between two measurements, usually the current inventory and the previous inventory, where the same plot is evaluated twice. Periodic annual growth is the increase in volume between inventories divided by the number of years between each inventory. This attribute is blank (null) if the plot does not contribute to the growth estimate.
* [INTEGER]   `type_of_annual_mortality_volume_code`
  - A code indicating how mortality volume is estimated. Current annual mortality is an estimate of the volume of trees dying in the year before the plot was measured, and is based on the year of death or on a modeled estimate. Periodic annual mortality is an estimate of the average annual volume of trees dying between two measurements, usually the current inventory and previous inventory, where the same plot is evaluated twice. Periodic annual mortality is the loss of volume between inventories divided by the number of years between each inventory. Periodic average annual mortality is the most common type of annual mortality estimated. This attribute is blank (null) if the plot does not contribute to the mortality estimate.
* [STRING]    `type_of_annual_mortality_volume_code_name`
  - A code indicating how mortality volume is estimated. Current annual mortality is an estimate of the volume of trees dying in the year before the plot was measured, and is based on the year of death or on a modeled estimate. Periodic annual mortality is an estimate of the average annual volume of trees dying between two measurements, usually the current inventory and previous inventory, where the same plot is evaluated twice. Periodic annual mortality is the loss of volume between inventories divided by the number of years between each inventory. Periodic average annual mortality is the most common type of annual mortality estimated. This attribute is blank (null) if the plot does not contribute to the mortality estimate.
* [INTEGER]   `phase_2_panel_number`
  - The value for Phase 2 panel number ranges from 1 to 5 for annual inventories and is blank (null) for periodic inventories. A panel is a sample in which the same elements are measured on two or more occasions. FIA divides the plots in each State into 5 panels that can be used to independently sample the population.
* [INTEGER]   `phase_3_panel_number`
  - A panel is a sample in which the same elements are measured on two or more occasions. FIA divides the plots in each State into 5 panels that can be used to independently sample the population. The value for Phase 3 panel number ranges from 1 to 5 for those plots where Phase 3 data were collected. If the plot is not a Phase 3 plot, then this attribute is left blank (null).
* [STRING]    `ecological_subsection_code`
  - An area of similar surficial geology, lithology, geomorphic process, soil groups, subregional climate, and potential natural communities. Subsection boundaries usually correspond with discrete changes in geomorphology. Subsection information is used for broad planning and assessment. Subsection codes for the coterminous United States were developed as part of the "Ecological Subregions: Sections and Subsections for the Conterminous United States" (Cleland and others 2007). For Alaska, the ecological section codes are equivalent to the ecoregions designated by Nowacki and others in Ecoregions of Alaska: 2001. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 02-297 (map). The ecological subsection code is based on fuzzed and swapped plot coordinates. This attribute is coded for the coterminous United States, southeast and south coastal Alaska, and is left blank (null) in all other instances
* [INTEGER]   `congressional_district_code`
  - A territorial division of a State from which a member of the U.S. House of Representatives is elected. The congressional district code assigned to a plot (regardless of when it was measured) is for the current Congress; the assignment is made based on the plot's approximate coordinates. CONGCD is a four-digit number. The first two digits are the State FIPS code and the last two digits are the congressional district number. If a State has only one congressional district, the congressional district number is 00. If a plot's congressional district assignment falls in a State other than the plot's actual State due to using the approximate coordinates, the congressional district code will be for the nearest congressional district in the correct State. This attribute is coded for the coterminous States and Alaska, and is left blank (null) in all other instances. For more information about the coverage used to assign this attribute, see National Atlas of the United States (2007).

* [STRING]    `microplot_location`
  - Values are 'OFFSET' or 'CENTER.' The offset microplot center is located 12 feet due east (90 degrees) of subplot center. The current standard is that the microplot is located in the 'OFFSET' location, but some earlier inventories, including some early panels of the annual inventory, may contain data where the microplot was located at the 'CENTER' location. Populated for annual inventory and may be populated for periodic inventory.
* [FLOAT]     `declination`
  - The azimuth correction used to adjust magnetic north to true north. All azimuths are assumed to be magnetic azimuths unless otherwise designated. The Portland FIA work unit historically has corrected all compass readings for true north. This field is to be used only in cases where FIA work units are adjusting azimuths to correspond to true north; for FIA work units using magnetic azimuths, this field will always be set = 0 in the office. This field carries a decimal place because the USGS corrections are provided to the nearest half degree. DECLINATION is defined as: DECLINATION = (TRUE NORTH - MAGNETIC NORTH)
* [INTEGER]   `emap_hexagon`
  - The identifier for the approximately 160,000 acre Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) hexagon in which the plot is located.

If macroplots are not being installed, this item will be left blank (null).
* [INTEGER]   `intensity`
  - A code used to identify federal base grid annual inventory plots and plots that have been added to intensify a particular sample. Under the federal base grid, one plot is collected in each theoretical hexagonal polygon, which is slightly more than 5,900 acres in size. Plots with INTENSITY = 1 are part of the federal base grid. In some instances, States and/or agencies have provided additional support to increase the sampling intensity for an area. Supplemental plots have INTENSITY set to higher numbers depending on the amount of plot intensification chosen for the particular estimation unit. Populated for annual inventory data only.
* [INTEGER]   `plot_inventory_cycle_number`
