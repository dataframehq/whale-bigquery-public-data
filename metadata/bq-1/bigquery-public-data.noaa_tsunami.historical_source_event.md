* [INTEGER]   `id`
  - The unique numeric identifier of the record.
* [INTEGER]   `year`
  - Valid values: -2000 to Present Format +/-yyyy (-is B.C, +is A.D.)  The Date and Time are given in Universal Coordinated Time (also known as Greenwich Mean Time). The local date may be one day different.  Please see the Caveat and Uncertainties in the Significant Earthquake and Tsunami Databases in the Significant Earthquake Database Introduction for more information on the completeness and accuracy of this database.

* [INTEGER]   `day`
  - Valid values: 1-31 (where months apply) The Date and Time are given in Universal Coordinated Time (also known as Greenwich Mean Time). The local date may be one day different.
* [DATETIME]  `timestamp`
  - Timestamp in UTC.
* [INTEGER]   `event_validity`
  - Valid values: -1 to 4 Validity of the actual tsunami occurrence is indicated by a numerical rating of the reports of that event:  4 = definite tsunami 3 = probable tsunami 2 = questionable tsunami 1 = very doubtful tsunami 0 = event that only caused a seiche or disturbance in an inland river -1 = erroneous entry
* [INTEGER]   `cause_code`
  - Valid values: 0 to 11 The source of the tsunami:  0 = Unknown 1 = Earthquake 2 = Questionable Earthquake 3 = Earthquake and Landslide 4 = Volcano and Earthquake 5 = Volcano, Earthquake, and Landslide 6 = Volcano 7 = Volcano and Landslide 8 = Landslide 9 = Meteorological 10 = Explosion 11 = Astronomical Tide
* [INTEGER]   `focal_depth`
  - Valid values: 0 to 700 km The depth of the earthquake is given in kilometers.
* [FLOAT]     `primary_magnitude`
  - Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9 The value in this column contains the primary earthquake magnitude. Magnitude measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake. Magnitude is determined from measurements on seismographs. For pre-instrumental events, the magnitudes are derived from intensities. There are several different scales for measuring earthquake magnitudes. The primary magnitude is chosen from the available magnitude scales in this order:  Mw Magnitude  Ms Magnitude  Mb Magnitude  Ml Magnitude  Mfa Magnitude  Unknown Magnitude
* [STRING]    `country`
  - The Country where the tsunami source occurred (For example enter: Japan or Russia)

* [STRING]    `location_name`
  - The Country, State, Province or Island where the tsunami source occurred (For example enter: Japan or Honshu) This is only an approximate geographic location. Events prior to 1900 were not instrumentally located, therefore, the location given is based on the latitude and longitude of the city where the maximum effects occurred. If there are different spellings of a city name the additional names are in parentheses.
* [FLOAT]     `latitude`
  - Valid values: -90 to +90 Latitude: 0 to 90 (Northern Hemisphere) -90 to 0 (Southern Hemisphere)  Events prior to 1900 were not instrumentally located, therefore, the location given is based on the latitude and longitude of the city where the maximum effects occurred.  The event coordinates of over 800 tsunami sources in this database are not known and the latitude and longitude are listed as null. Therefore, to retrieve all the events from a particular country or state, leave the event coordinates search parameter blank and enter the country or select the region name.
* [FLOAT]     `longitude`
  - Valid values: -180 to +180 Longitude: 0 to 180 (Eastern Hemisphere) -180 to 0 (Western Hemisphere)  Events prior to 1900 were not instrumentally located, therefore, the location given is based on the latitude and longitude of the city where the maximum effects occurred.  The event coordinates of over 800 tsunami sources in this database are not known and the latitude and longitude are listed as null. Therefore, to retrieve all the events from a particular country or state, leave the event coordinates search parameter blank and enter the country or select the region name.
