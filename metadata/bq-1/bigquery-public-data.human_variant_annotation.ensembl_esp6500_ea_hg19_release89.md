## Column details
* [STRING]    `reference_name`
  - An identifier from the reference genome or an angle-bracketed ID string pointing to a contig in the assembly file.
* [INTEGER]   `start`
  - The reference position, with the first base having position 0.
* [INTEGER]   `end`
  - End position of the variant described in this record.
* [STRING]    `reference_bases`
  - Each base must be one of A,C,G,T,N (case insensitive). Multiple bases are permitted. The value in the 'start' field refers to the position of the first base in the string.
* [STRING]    `alternate_bases`
  - List of alternate non-reference alleles.
* [STRING]    `variant_id`
  - Google Genomics variant id.
* [FLOAT]     `quality`
  - Phred-scaled quality score for the assertion made in ALT.
* [STRING]    `filter`
* [STRING]    `names`
  - List of unique identifiers for the variant where available.
* [RECORD]    `call`
  - Per-sample measurements.
* [STRING]    `call.call_set_id`
  - The id of the callset from which this data was exported from the Google Genomics Variants API.

* [INTEGER]   `call.genotype`
  - List of genotypes.
* [STRING]    `call.phaseset`
  - If this value is null, the data is unphased.  Otherwise it is phased.
* [FLOAT]     `call.genotype_likelihood`
  - List of genotype likelihoods.
