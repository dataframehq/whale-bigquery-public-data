# `fcc_political_ads.content_info`
`bq-1` | `bigquery-public-data`
This data table aims to extract useful information from the raw receipt PDF files available from the FCC. Data in this table has been manually extracted and annotated by ProPublicaâ€™s Free the Files Effort or Google. This is an experimental dataset based on humans reading PDFs and extracting data, and there may be errors- please do not use as a complete or comprehensive dataset. Current annotation efforts will omit files that lack gross spend, advertiser or ad air date information.This table will be continually expanded with additional annotated files.
